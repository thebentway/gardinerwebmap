# [Under Gardiner Archival Photo Map](https://thebentway.github.io/gardinerwebmap/)


The site of the Gardiner Expressway has a long, storied history. There are multiple perspectives to unravel. Explore past and present perspectives across the decades by sifting through this photographic record. Drawing on documentation from the City of Toronto Archive and Toronto Public Library,  the Under Gardiner Archival Photo Map is an interactive resource anchored by and around the elevated expressway.

Images can be filtered chronologically, using the slider on the left and sorted by themes using the tags on the right hand side.

View the project on the [Under Gardiner Public Realm Plan website](https://undergardinerprp.ca/learn/).
